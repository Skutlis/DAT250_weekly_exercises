## Technical problems

I had problems to compile and and run the compiled files through the terminal when i used a maven project. <br>
I solved this by extracting the java-files from that project, and put them together in a folder with all the jars needed<br>
to run RabbitMQ. The errors i got was ClasNotFound and ClassDefNotFound
