## Technical problems
I initially wanted to do all tutorials in the same project, which initially worked fine. <br>
But, after adding the file "app.groovy" from tutorial2 the code did not run. <br>
I therefor split up the tutorials to 3 different projects: <br> 
Tutorial 1+3 <br>
Totorial 2 <br>
Tutorial 4 <br>

## Links
Tutorial 1+3: https://github.com/Skutlis/SpringTutorial <br>
Tutorial 2: https://github.com/Skutlis/SpringbootTutorial2/tree/main <br>
Tutorial 4: https://github.com/Skutlis/SpringbootTutorial4 <br>
