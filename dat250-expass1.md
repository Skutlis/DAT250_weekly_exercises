## Process
First i needed to verify that my computer was set up after the criteria given in the task. This was mainly done in the terminal. <br>
Secondly, i started on my heroku app. After downloading all the necessities, I started the creation my first heroku app. <br>
This went pretty smooth. I had some errors due to not reading the guide carefully enough, which were corrected after a careful read of the guide.


## Installation
I verified my java jdk by opening the terminal and executed the command "java --version", which verifyed that i have a java jdk on my computer. <br>
I verified my IDE by opening Intellij on my computer.<br>
I verified that i had Maven by executing the command "mvn --version" in terminal, which returned my current version of maven<br>
I verified that i had a git client by executing the command "git --version", which verified that it was installed<br>

## Heroku
I didn't really encounter any technical problems. I did however encounter a small problem where i forgot to change the string which <br>
was printed to the /hello page, so the value of energy didn't change from 12 to 20 GeV. This was corrected as soon as I relized. <br>
