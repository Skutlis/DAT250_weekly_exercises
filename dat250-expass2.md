## Technical problems
I encountered a couple of problems. First problem was that the new versions of the eclipselink folder didn't contain the jars <br>
needed for this exercise. Secondly, i had problems with erors because my database was open in the database inspector in Intellij. <br>

## Inspection
I inspected the tables with the Database extension in Intellij ultimate edition. This was done by linking the path and logging <br>
in with the credentials defined in the percistence.xml file. <br>

## Pending issues
I didn't get the test to run properly at the end(they did run at some point) due to an error i can't understand:

And about 90 more lines of exceptions.. <br>
Everything is in the database, so i don't really understand this problem.
