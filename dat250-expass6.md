## Technical problems & pending issues
I couldn't get the "get" method to update the tables, so that makes it hard to verify the other methods<br>
I can see that todos get posted to the database, but i cannot verify the delete-funcgtion without any data being displayed<br>

## UPDATE
I finally got all functionality to work. The solution: I had to add some functionality in the rest, <br>
namely an option(/*) which allowed all sources to connect to the REST api. When this was done, the rest<br>
fell in place pretty quickly.
